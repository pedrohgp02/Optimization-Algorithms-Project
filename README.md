# Optimization Algorithms

## Overview

This project involves exploring optimization algorithms, particularly hill-climbing and genetic algorithms, to solve optimization problems. The assignment includes implementing and improving these algorithms to find global optima on complex error surfaces.

## Project Structure

1. **Hill Climbing in Python**: Implementation of a hill-climbing algorithm to minimize an error function.
2. **Algorithm Enhancement**: Modifying the hill-climbing algorithm to include random restarts, improving its ability to find global optima.
3. **Genetic Algorithm**: Developing a genetic algorithm as an alternative approach to solve the optimization problem.
4. **Testing and Visualization**: Evaluating the algorithms using different error landscapes and visualizing the results.

## Files

- `FA ASSIGNMENT.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the hill-climbing and genetic algorithm implementations, along with testing and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open `FA ASSIGNMENT.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the implementations.
2. **Test the Algorithms**: Modify the starting points, step sizes, and other parameters to see how the algorithms perform on different error surfaces.
3. **Visualization**: Use the provided plotting functions to visualize the optimization process and the resulting paths.
